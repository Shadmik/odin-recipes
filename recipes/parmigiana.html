                <div id="article"><span style="font-size:32px;">Description:</span> <br> <br>Parmigiana-pasta is a dish
                    that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or
                    provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.
                    The dish originated from 20th-century Italian diaspora. It has been speculated that the
                    dish is based on a combination of the Italian melanzane alla Parmigiana, a dish using breaded
                    eggplant slices instead of chicken, with a cotoletta, a breaded veal cutlet generally served without
                    sauce or cheese in Italy.</div>

                    <ol>
                        <li> For the pangrattato, place the bread in a food processor and process to coarse breadcrumbs. Heat a large frying pan over low-medium heat and add the breadcrumbs, garlic and oil. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly, until the breadcrumbs and garlic are golden brown. Season with salt and put in a large bowl to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, stir through the parsley.

                        </li>

                        <li>Brush out the pan with a paper towel to remove any breadcrumbs and increase the heat to medium. Add the olive oil and eggplant and cook the eggplant for around 8 minutes until golden brown on all sides. Remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon, add the pancetta and cook for about 5 minutes until browned and crisp.</li>
                        <li> Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon, add the onion and garlic and cook for about 4 minutes until fragrant, then add the passata, salt and ½ cup of water. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat and simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li>While the tomato sauce is cooking, cook the pasta in plenty of salted water according to the packet directions. When the pasta is al dente, transfer the pasta to the tomato sauce and add the eggplant and pancetta. Mix well to combine, then turn off the heat. Just before serving, stir through the mozzarella cubes. Serve immediately with the pangrattato (or parmesan, if you prefer).</li>
